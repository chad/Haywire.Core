The current vector clock implementation is a port of the [Voldemort vector clock](http://code.google.com/p/project-voldemort/source/browse/trunk/src/java/voldemort/versioning/VectorClock.java?r=170 "Voldemort vector clock") Java implementation. This version will likely take on a different shape but it was used as a starting point.
